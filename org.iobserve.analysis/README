Presently, the pom.xml relies on a system library folder. This solution
is only temporary. Unfortunately, it is necessary, as the libraries in
https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/eclipse/palladio/core/pcm/releases/4.0.0/
are inaccessible for Maven.

Please adapt the following line in the pom.xml to your eclipse plugin
installation.

<lib.location>/home/rju/eclipse-mars/plugins</lib.location>
