5. Resolving dependency issues:

5.1 Maven-Issues:

In org.iobserve.analysis:

Open pom.xml
- Adjust the <lib.location.palladio> to your palladio installation folder/Plugins
- Adjust the <lib.location> to path to org.iobserve.analysis/libs

5.2 Missing folder issue:
In org.iobserve.monitoring:

If there is this folders are missing add them by right click on the project >
BuildPath > NewSourceFolder

Folder which have to be there:

src/test/java
src/test/resource
src/main/resource
src/gen/java: If this is missing add it manually by:
	- right click on project -> New -> Source Folder > type: src/gen/java > finish
	once this is done you should have an additional src folder with the package
	org.iobserve.analysis.data.


5.3 Eclipse-Libs issue:

5.3.1 Create a UserLibrary
Window > Preferences > Java > BuildPath > User Libraries > Add
Give it a name
Select the created library and clicke > Add External Jars

5.3.2 Add the User library to org.iobserve.analysis
